## Abstract
In web3 an identity is represented by an address rather than a username or password. When a web3 entity try to communicate with other entities using web2 social media platforms, they find it difficult because of this difference in identity. We at notiboy are building applications that will make communication more effective for algofam. Our notification service helps the web3 projects to effectively communicate with end-user addresses. As a next step, we would like to build a web3 specific chat application that will facilitate address-to-address communication. This application will be integrated into our web and mobile apps. APIs will be made available that can be integrated by the web3 projects to provide a in-app chat experience for their end-users.

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Build Chat Application.
Date: 3 months

Amount: 85000

Description:
    -We intend to build a basic address-to-address chat application and integrate it into our current application.
    - Featutrs include 1) Ping an address to start a chat 2) Start chat on approval from the pinged address. 

### Future Milestones: APIs as service
Date: 1 month

Amount: 10700

Description:
    -Release apis as a service so that projects can integrate chat app into their web3 application.

## Benefits for the community
1) Community members can interact with each other by using an algorand address as their identity. Currently, members have to expose their web2 identities, like email-id or phone numbers via a web2 platform to interact with other members or web3 projects.

2) Web3 projects on algorand can integrate our APIs to their application thus providing an in-app chat experience for 
their end-users.
