## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
This open-source browser "match-2/memory" game will be available for use to anyone in the Algorand community. It is a fun way to ENGAGE a community and to SHOWCASE an NFT collection or a collection of NFTs from different projects (you can fill the tiles with your own NFTs, or randomly with NFTs from different NFT collections). It also adds additional UTILITY to an NFT collection as it allows projects to host competitions for their community, run promotional giveaways, or just to flex their superior art. We will maintain the platform and rotate “spotlight” collections, but as it’s also open-sourced other projects or community will be able to deploy their own version with the customizations they require. Try the MVP version of the game here:  <a href="https://cosmic-match.vercel.app" target="_blank">https://cosmic-match.vercel.app</a>

## Future Blueprint
The platform has huge potential for future development by adding s simple self-hosted competition/giveaways options for proejcts to gain exposure and to engage their own and new communities.

## Benefits for the community
It is a fun way to ENGAGE a community and to SHOWCASE an NFT collection or a collection of NFTs from different projects. It also adds additional UTILITY to any NFT collection as it allows projects to host competitions with their NFT collections, run promotional giveaways, or just to flex their superior art in specific collections. It’s also open-sourced anyone will be able to deploy their own version with the customizations they require.
