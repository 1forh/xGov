## Abstract
Humanity keeps reliable knowledge in white papers. White papers are summarized in encyclopedias. The best (though not perfect) existing encyclopedia is Wikipedia. Let's bring it to web3.

Given any statement (a sentence, a white paper, an article, etc.), anyone can vote on the veracity (as a number) of this statement between 0 and 1, 0 meaning absolutely false, 1 meaning absolutely true, or any number inbetween.

Each voter will own on-chain identities (NFTs) which are attached to the vote.

A frontend allows any user to inquire the average veracity for a given statement filtered on some combination of identities.
Examples:
"What do professional biologists think about Darwin's paper on evolution?"
"What do people of my city think about the paper that claims that timezones and daylight savings are useless?"

Every person is free to choose it's own judgement of any statement. Now we provide transparent data to help the person choose make up it's own mind.

The voting is incentivised via reward coins, which could be traded in open markets, giving them value.

We would start with universities, by handing out academic identities via academic emails. The burden of identity checking is kept with universities. After, institutes of accreditation can be added (e.g. Lawyers, Doctors, etc.). Eventually, governments will be giving their citizens identities on-chain. Any and all reliable on-chain identity providers can be added to the system.
