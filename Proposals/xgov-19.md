## Abstract
A dashboard that monitors the Algorand foundation market operations in 2023 that updates daily. 

## Team
https://twitter.com/sotpapasot

Blockchain data analyst working with Algorand data for more than a year. 

## Experience with Algorand
Building data analytics for Algorand DeFi and NFT protocols. I can aggregate data for any asset, application or account on Algorand

## Roadmap
The beta version is already available here.

It includes a pivot table with all the transactions from the two foundation accounts, a bar chart showing monthly expenses and an area chart showing the cumulative spending for 2023.
The requested amount is for covering my time to develop the queries and visualizations. 
I will be available for feedback from the community in order to improve or add more charts to the dashboard. 

## Benefits for the community
- Faster than extracting transactions as csv files from a blockchain explorer. 
- Onchain evidence that the Algorand Foundation is allocating funds for market operations. 
- Almost real time data, unlike the transparency report which would be released every quarter. 

## Additional information
Open to work on other dashboards that are related to the Foundation's activities, such as Algorand Ventures, ecosystem growth funds etc.
