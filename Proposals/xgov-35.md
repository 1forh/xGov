## Abstract
Cometa has become one of the main staking platforms in Algorand ecosystem. Currently, we have 56 pools from 33 different projects.

We would like to improve the UX and introduce a few new features, but we don't have funds to develop it. We think even a small amount could make a big impact for the whole ecosystem.

We don't want to raise the fees even more, because it would restrain small project from creating the pools.

## Experience with Algorand
 
* We were the first project to implement <b>NFT random shuffle</b> application. With that we won [Innovative Hackaton](https://developer.algorand.org/articles/innovate-hackathon-2021/) in Digital Art/Collectibles Challenge. We had used Reach and Algorand RPC servers.
* We were the first project to implement <b>true staking algorithm</b>, which gives you rewards each block instead of epochs. Cometa was born.
* We used <b>Reach</b> language to build staking smart-contracts and [open-sourced](https://github.com/MetaLabsOG/cometa-lm-contract) it.
* We were the first project to implement <b>compound feature</b> for staking. It's a backend work, but still it works.
* We used PyTeal to create LaaS MVP and have released MPV on [the testnet](https://app.testnet.cometa.farm/laas).
* During the development process we developed our own AlgoBuilder fork to make it more usable and supporting the latest version of AlgoSDK. But it's not production-ready.
* We have partnered with all the major projects in the ecosystem to provide them staking services.
* We were <b>Runner Up winners</b> of the [pitch competition](https://twitter.com/AlgoFoundation/status/1597963052074180608?s=20) <b>on Decipher</b> with our LaaS concept.
* We had been running our own Algorand Node and Indexer for a while, until we understood it's much easier to use other services like AlgoExplorer and Algonode.

## Roadmap

* 2 weeks to fix current platform issues, return pool creation feature and make the platform robust and to have at least 99.9% uptime.
* 2-3 weeks to fix Cometa Telegram Bot and provide a few new features:
* * Show all the current user pools with stake and rewards amounts and cost.
* * Notify all bot users about new pools. Also make an announcement in our Telegram Channel.
* * Notify users when it's the best time to compound. With a few settings and projected APYs.
* * Allow to track not only a single address, but a list of addresses.
* * Put gpt-4 insied for customer support and advising on the current pools. **[optional]**
* 1 week to allow projects the creation of NFT rewards for their pools. (it's already working, but has to be set up manually by us)
* Hire a part-time SMM guy to handle out Twitter, partnerships and customer support. 2 months paycheck.


We also want to implement a Discord Bot as well. But that would need development from scratch and not the priority. Or better said, not economically viable at the moment. Still, if community decides, we could do that instead of Telegram bot. But that could require a bit more time.

**We'd love to hear** more suggestions from the community on how to make Cometa more convenient and useful for the ecosystem!

Some features could be replaced with community suggestions, since our goal is not to implement something, but to bring the community the best value.

But please keep in mind, that some features could be harder to implement thus could not fit in the budget.

## Benefits for the community
### Benefits to the ecosystem

* Reliable staking platform with convenient and fast UI/UX.
* Maximizing profits for stakers.
* NFT rewards which is fun.
* More activities for the community, which is also fun and profitable.

### Benefits to other projects
* Ability to create a robust staking for their tokens at any moment.
* Ability to add NFT rewards for their pools at any moment to attract more stakers.
* Being sure that all our users will always know about the creation of their pools immediately.
* Cross-marketing to help smaller projects gain attention.

## Additional information

We are not getting funds to finish the LaaS, since it requires much more. For that we still need investment. If we are lucky to finally get it, it will be done.

The sum would be enough for 2 months work, after which platform would be fully autonomous and should work like clockwork. We hope that after that we'll have bigger revenue, which would allow us to continue developing on our own.
