## Abstract
Cometa has become one of the main staking platforms in Algorand ecosystem. Currently, we have 56 pools from 33 different projects.

We would like to improve the UX and introduce a few new features, but we don't have funds to develop it. We think even a small amount could make a big impact for the whole ecosystem.

We don't want to raise the fees, because it would restrain small project from creating the pools.

## Experience with Algorand
 
* We were the first project to implement <b>NFT random shuffle</b> application. With that we won **Innovative Hackaton** in 2021 in _Digital Art/Collectibles Challenge_. We had used **Reach** and **Algorand RPC** servers.
* We were the first project to implement <b>true staking algorithm</b>, which gives you rewards each block instead of epochs. Cometa was born.
* We used <b>Reach</b> language to build staking smart-contracts and **open-sourced** it. It's available on our Github (no links here).
* We were the first project to implement <b>compound feature</b> for staking. It's a backend work, but still it works.
* We used PyTeal to create LaaS MVP and have released MPV **on the testnet**, please check it out.
* During the development process we developed our own AlgoBuilder fork to make it more usable and supporting the latest version of AlgoSDK. But it's not production-ready.
* We have partnered with all the major projects in the ecosystem to provide them staking services.
* We were <b>Runner Up winners</b> of the **pitch competition** <b>on Decipher</b> in 2022 with our **LaaS** concept.
* We had been running our own Algorand Node and Indexer for a while, until we understood it's much easier to use other services like AlgoExplorer and Algonode.

## Roadmap

* 2 weeks to fix current platform issues and bugs to make the platform robust and to have at least 99.9% uptime.
* 1 week to optimize backend API for Pools State, User Pools State.
* 1 week to allow projects the creation of NFT rewards for their pools. (it's already working, but has to be set up manually by us)
* 1 week to allow projects to pay fees fully in ALGO instead of percent of the tokens.
* 2-3 weeks to fix Cometa Telegram Bot and provide a few new features:
* * Show all the current user pools with stake and rewards amounts and cost.
* * Notify all bot users about new pools. Also automatically make an announcement in our Telegram Channel.
* * Notify users when it's the best time to compound. With a few settings and projected APYs.
* * Allow to track not only a single address, but a list of addresses.
* * Put gpt-4 inside for customer support and advising on the current pools.
* **Or 3-5 weeks** to implement a Discord Bot with the same functionality instead of Telegram Bot.
* Hire a part-time SMM guy to handle out Twitter, partnerships and customer support. At least 2 months paycheck.


**We'd love to hear** more suggestions from the community on how to make Cometa more convenient and useful for the ecosystem!

Some features could be replaced with community suggestions, since _our goal is not to implement something_, but **to bring** the community the best **value**.

But please keep in mind, that some features could be harder to implement thus could not fit in the budget.

## Benefits for the community
### Benefits to the ecosystem

* Reliable staking/farming platform with convenient and fast UI/UX.
* Increasing profits for stakers, providing the info about optimal APY.
* NFT rewards, which connects DeFi and NFTs.
* Adding more features for the community providing a go-to hub for everyone.

### Benefits to other projects
* Ability to create a robust staking for their tokens at any moment.
* Ability to add NFT rewards for their pools at any moment to attract more holders.
* Being sure that all our users will always know about the creation of their pools immediately and not asking us to announce manually.
* Cross-marketing to help smaller projects gain attention, so the ecosystem could grow faster as a whole.

## Summary

The sum would be enough for 3 months work, after which platform will be fully autonomous and will work like clockwork. We will have the ability to capitalize on profits which will allow us to continue building more efficiently after the upgrades.
