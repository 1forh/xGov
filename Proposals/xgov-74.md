## Abstract
We at Notiboy has a vision to make web3 communication more efficient. That means the algorand addresses should be able to communicate with each other by maintaining their privacy. So we are developing a chat application which will help the addresses to chat between each other in an anonymous way. There will also be a facility for group chat which will help formation and development of web3 communites. The users will also be able to send/transfer assets between addresses during their chat.

## Present Proposal
In web3 an identity is represented by an address rather than a username or password. When a web3 entity try to communicate with other entities using web2 social media platforms, they find it difficult because of this difference in identity. We at notiboy are building applications that will make communication more effective for algofam. Our notification service helps the web3 projects to effectively communicate with end-user addresses. As a next step, we would like to build a web3 specific chat application that will facilitate address-to-address communication. This application will be integrated into our web and mobile apps. APIs will be made available that can be integrated by the web3 projects to provide a in-app chat experience for their end-users. This will have address to address chat feature, group chat feature which helps in development of web3 communities. The users will also be able to swap/transfer assets while chatting which adds to convenience of web3 ecosystem on Algorand.

## Benefits for the community
1) Community members can interact with each other by using an algorand address as their identity. Currently, members have to expose their web2 identities, like email-id or phone numbers via a web2 platform to interact with other members or web3 projects.

2) Web3 projects on algorand can integrate our APIs to their application thus providing an in-app chat experience for 
their end-users.
