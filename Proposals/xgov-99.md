## Abstract
This proposal outlines a comprehensive educational initiative aimed at empowering new developers in the blockchain space, particularly within the Algorand ecosystem. The project centers on a 10-part YouTube series dedicated to developing Discord bots, a common entry point for many aspiring blockchain developers. The series will be complemented by open-sourcing all related code, thus providing a valuable resource for practical learning and innovation in the community.

## Background
The intersection of blockchain technology and Discord bot development presents a unique opportunity for aspiring developers. However, the lack of open-source resources and comprehensive guides has created a barrier to entry. This initiative seeks to address this gap by leveraging the Algorand blockchain's capabilities.

## Authorâ€™s Credentials
- **Name:** Costa, Leo CPhT-Adv
- **Experience:**
  - Two years of development experience on the Algorand blockchain.
  - Created and assisted in developing multiple Discord bots
  - Six months of web application development.
  - Proficiency in Algorand and Discord SDK's, node setup, database usage, and blockchain querying.

## Detailed Proposal
**Series Outline:**
1. **Episide 1: Basic Setup:** Discord bot token generation, Algorand node setup, Python/Pip installation, module installations (AlgoSDK, aiohttp, Discord.py), and setting up Visual Studio Code and Ubuntu terminals on Windows.
2. **Episodes 2 - 10. Advanced Techniques and Applications:** Detailed tutorials on wallet syncing, node connectivity, presenting ASA balance and metadata, converting in-game data to ASAs, interactive game development, and more.

**Timeline:**
- The series will be released bi-weekly over the course of 20 weeks, ensuring ample time for community feedback and iteration.

## Future Blueprint
Based on community feedback, future proposals will focus on:
- Backend/frontend web application development on Algorand.
- Development using Unity SDK, Swift SDK, and React Native, as per community interest.

## Community Benefits
- **Onboarding Platform:** Facilitates an easy entry point for community members into Algorand development.
- **Practical Learning:** Offers hands-on experience through guided tutorials.
- **Innovation Stimulus:** Encourages the creation of new, blockchain-integrated projects.
