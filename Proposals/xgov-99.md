## Abstract
This proposal outlines a comprehensive educational initiative aimed at empowering new developers in the blockchain space, particularly within the Algorand ecosystem. The project centers on a 10-part YouTube series dedicated to developing Discord bots in Python using the Algorand SDK, a common entry point for many aspiring blockchain developers. The series will be complemented by open-sourcing all related code, thus providing a valuable resource for practical learning and innovation in the community. For each episode, the python that we utilize is explained in detail before we progress to more complex walkthroughs where we utilize discord bots and the Algorand SDK. 

## Background
The intersection of blockchain technology and Discord bot development presents a unique opportunity for aspiring developers. However, the lack of open-source resources and comprehensive guides for even basic python usage on Algorand and an entry-level platform has created a barrier to entry. This initiative seeks to address this gap by leveraging the Algorand blockchain's capabilities.

## Author’s Credentials
- **Name:** Leo Costa, CPhT-Adv
- **Experience:**
  - Two years of development experience on the Algorand blockchain.
  - Created and assisted in developing multiple Discord bots
  - Six months of web application development.
  - Proficiency in Algorand and Discord SDK's, node setup, database usage, and blockchain querying.

## Detailed Proposal
**Series Outline:**

**EPISODE 1 - Setup**
In the first episode of building an Algorand blockchain-based Discord bot on a Windows PC, we walk through these steps in order: installing Ubuntu, manually setting up an Algorand node, getting Visual Studio and its extensions, Python, pip, and the Algo Python standard kit installed. We'll also get our Discord server and bot ready for testing by sorting out permissions, setting a secret bot token, and configuring our code to connect to the Algorand blockchain and the Discord bot.

**EPISODE 2 - Wallet Integration and Payment Transactions**
In this episode, we'll cover some basic Python concepts including variables, functions, calls, return statements, lists, dictionaries, conditional statements, and for loops. We will apply these concepts while creating a simple Discord bot for handling payment transactions, registering users' Algorand addresses, and accessing account information on the Algorand Blockchain."

**EPISODE 3 - [1/2] Pokemon Battle Discord Bot: Coding Without Node, Creating Metadata Templates, Uploading Images to IPFS, ARC-69 Standard Asset Creation Transactions**
Create Pokémon-esque characters using ARC-69s on Algorand Blockchain— we’ll go over metadata templates, IPFS uploading for image hosting, list/dictionary review, and sending asset configuration transactions without a node! This is a two-part episode which will be followed by Episode 4, where we learn how to create a Pokemon battling Discord bot and alter properties of our Pokémon NFTs like experience, levels, and even make them evolve!

**EPISODE 4 - [2/2] Pokemon Battle Discord Bot: Simulating Training and Battles via Discord Bot using the PIL Library and Embeds, Pulling Data using Algonode Indexer for Current Pokemon Stats, Asset Configuration Transactions to Increment Stats, Level-up and Evolve Pokemon**

**EPISODE 5 - Discord Card Game Bot and Asset Transfer Transactions**

**EPISODE 6 - Replicating A Pseud-Algoexplorer.io Platform with a Discord Bot by Analyzing Blocks**

**EPISODE 7 - Encrypting Messages in Note Fields and Creating a Direct Messaging Discord Bot**

**EPISODE 8 - Creating and Funding Discord Bot Wallets to Simulate Wagers or Staking**

**EPISODE 9 - Write and Deploy Smart Contract using PUYA from Algokit 2.0, and Integrate Smart Contract with a Discord Bot**

**EPISODE 10 - Preparing for the Second Series, Intro to Javascript and Web Applications**

**Timeline:**
- The series will be released bi-weekly over the course of 20 weeks, (3 episodes have already been released) ensuring ample time for community feedback and iteration.

## Future Blueprint
Based on community feedback, future proposals will focus on:
- Backend/frontend web application development on Algorand.
- Development using React Native, and perhaps the Unity, Unreal or Swift SDK as per community interest.

## Community Benefits
- **Onboarding Platform:** Facilitates an easy entry point for community members into Algorand development.
- **Practical Learning:** Offers hands-on experience through guided and in-depth tutorials.
- **Innovation Stimulus:** Encourages the creation of new, blockchain-integrated projects.
