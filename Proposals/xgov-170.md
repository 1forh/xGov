## Abstract
This proposal seeks to fund a new no-code voting & agreement signing tool that will enable any user, brand, or community to deploy custom contracts for streamlined proposal creation, decentralized voting, agreement signing, and immutable record keeping.

The voting tool will be the most user-friendly voting & agreement signing tool within crypto, supporting a range of essential use cases for businesses and communities.

By providing essential decision-making features within an intuitive user-experience, the proposed tool aims to target and onboard teams and communities from within and beyond the Algorand and web3.

## Experience with Algorand
Jesco has been actively developing Algorand based projects for >3 years. In this time he has created ~20 PyTeal smart contracts and multiple Front / Back ends to support this. The smart contracts cover a wide range of application types, including staking, vesting, trading, and more.

Together, Mark and Jesco have been building the <a href="http://everyone.space">Everyone.space</a> platform for the past year. When launched, Everyone will provide important web3 utilities for the Algorand ecosystem.

## Present Proposal
The proposed Voting & Agreement Signing tool will enable anyone to create and deploy custom voting contracts aligned to their specific needs, whether that is critical decision-making, instant polling, agreement signing, or feedback acquisition.

The tool’s highly intuitive no-code UX will provide a streamlined and significantly improved experience across the whole proposal creation and voting lifecycle. The decentralized agreement signing features will be new capabilities within the Algorand ecosystem – providing essential tools for business.

We plan to target customers outside of the Algorand ecosystem, and outside of crypto. However, they will be required to have an Algorand wallet to interact with voting contracts. We will provide the necessary information and tutorials to streamline onboarding of new users.

The voting tool will be integrated with the upcoming Everyone platform, joining a suite of user-friendly no-code utilities for the Algorand network. This integrated approach, combining voting, signing, and immutable record keeping, facilitate a more cohesive decision making process.

Community decision making is a core feature of decentralized networks; it is critical that attention is paid to this area. As Algorand grows and takes up its rightful leadership role within crypto, we need to showcase the best possible decision making processes.

By providing best in class tools, we can increase participation in decision making, thereby promoting trust, community engagement, and inclusivity across the whole Algorand network.

Key Features:
* Voting contract configuration and deployment
  * A core feature within the voting system are no-code forms to configure and deploy dedicated voting smart contracts per team or project
* Multiple voting models to support diverse governance use cases
  * Simple Majority Voting
  * Supermajority Voting
  * Token-weighted voting
* Dedicated webpage for project-specific voting experiences
  * Projects can create a dedicated mini websites associated with their voting contract, providing comprehensive project information to users
  * Real-time voting and results
* Public and private voting
  * Support for sensitive decision-making and IP protection
* Access controls and user permissions
  * Specify requirements for proposal creation, voting, and agreement signing
* Enhanced transparency and trust
  * Immutable record keeping and verification
 
## Future Blueprint
We are here to support and update this project over the long term, far beyond the scope of this proposal.

## Benefits for the community
Key benefits:
* Build a product that is so useful and user-friendly that it helps drive the expansion of the Algorand user base.
* Provide an improved voting & agreement signing experience for Algorand ecosystem projects.
* Promote a fairer, more engaged, and inclusive ecosystem.
* We pledge to open-source the code in the event of any future project sunsetting
