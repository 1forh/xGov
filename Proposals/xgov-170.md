## Abstract
This proposal seeks to fund a new no-code voting/agreement signing tool that will enable any user, brand, or community to deploy custom contracts for streamlined proposal creation, decentralized decision-making, agreement signing, and immutable record keeping.

With a focus on accessibility and a high quality user-experience, the proposed tool aims to onboard teams and communities from within and outside the Algorand ecosystem.

The voting tool will be the most user-friendly voting/agreement signing tool within crypto, supporting a range of essential use cases for businesses and communities.

## Experience with Algorand
Jesco has been actively developing Algorand based projects for >3 years. In this time he has created ~20 PyTeal smart contracts and multiple Front / Back ends to support this. The smart contracts cover a wide range of application types, including staking, vesting, trading, and more.

Together, Mark and Jesco have been building the www.everyone.space platform for the past year. When launched, Everyone will provide key tokenization and NFT infrastructure for the Algorand ecosystem.

## Present Proposal
The proposed Voting / Agreement Signing tool will enable anyone to create custom contracts aligned to their project's specific needs, whether that is critical decision making, instant polling, agreement signing, or feedback acquisition.

The tool's highly intuitive no-code UX will streamline proposal creation, voting, and signing. It will enable easy onboarding to increase participation from existing Algorand projects, and more importantly, from new entrants to the Algorand ecosystem.

The voting tool will be integrated with the upcoming Everyone platform, joining a suite of user-friendly no-code utilities for the Algorand network. This integrated approach, combining voting, signing, and immutable record keeping, facilitate a more cohesive decision making process, promoting trust, engagement, and inclusivity across the Algorand ecosystem.

Key Features:
* No-code voting contract configuration and deployment
* Multiple voting models to support diverse governance use cases
* Dedicated webpage for project-specific voting experiences
  * Comprehensive project information
  * Real-time voting and results
  * Voting activity and history
* Public and private voting
  * Support for sensitive decision-making and IP protection
* Access controls and user permissions
  * Specify requirements for proposal creation and voting
* Enhanced transparency and trust
  * Immutable record keeping and verification

## Future Blueprint
We are here to support and update this project over the long term, far beyond the scope of this proposal.

## Benefits for the community
Key benefits:
* Build a product that is so useful and user-friendly that we drive expansion of the Algorand user base.
* Provide an improved voting/agreement signing experience for Algorand ecosystem projects.
* Promote a fairer, more engaged, and inclusive ecosystem.
