## Abstract
Choice Coin DAN is a decentralized autonomous network, choice software platform, and R&D hub that uses the Choice Coin cryptocurrency to power its software systems. The goal for this project is to create a decentralized compliance mechanism for digital assets on Algorand. 

One of the key features of governance software infrastructure currently missing from solutions on Algorand is compliance. As such, this grant will be for a web application and open source software for Choice Coin compliance software, which will be available to the Algorand network to help assist in the compliance process.

## Team
Brian Haney

In 2020, I successfully completed a yearlong Fellowship at Stanford Law School focusing on software patents for machine learning and successfully publishing several scholarly research papers. 
In 2021, I was on the Algorand Autonomous team that won top prize at the 2021 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon.
I have written several research papers about Algorand, developed substantial software on Algorand, and have successfully managed and contributed to open-source software development on Algorand. 
I am also active in the Algorand community including the <a href="https://forum.algorand.org/u/bhaney44/summary">Developer Forum</a>.

## Benefits for the community
A description of the potential benefits that the proposal could bring to the Algorand community and its users.

Enhanced Regulatory Compliance: The development of compliance software can help the Algorand community ensure adherence to regulatory requirements, particularly in the context of securities and commodities compliance. This can promote a more compliant ecosystem and mitigate legal and regulatory risks for participants.

Industry Leadership: By actively supporting and funding compliance software development, the Algorand community can establish itself as a leader in compliance within the blockchain industry. This can enhance the reputation and credibility of Algorand as a platform that takes compliance seriously and is committed to ethical practices.

Increased Adoption and Participation: A robust compliance software solution can attract institutional investors, businesses, and developers who prioritize regulatory compliance. The availability of reliable compliance tools may encourage a wider range of entities to engage with the Algorand ecosystem, driving increased adoption and participation.

Open Source Collaboration: Open-source development fosters collaboration among developers, researchers, and the broader community. By funding the open-source compliance software project, the Algorand community can leverage the expertise and contributions of a diverse range of individuals and organizations, leading to a more comprehensive and robust solution.

Transparent and Trustworthy Ecosystem: Compliance software can contribute to building a transparent and trustworthy ecosystem on Algorand. By providing tools that enable participants to navigate regulatory requirements, it becomes easier to establish trust among stakeholders. This can attract both individual and institutional users who value transparency and compliance.

Regulatory Innovation: The development of compliance software on Algorand can serve as a catalyst for regulatory innovation within the blockchain space. By actively engaging with compliance challenges and finding innovative solutions, the Algorand community can influence regulatory discussions and potentially shape the future regulatory landscape in a favorable manner.

Community Empowerment: Open-source development empowers the community by providing access to compliance tools and resources. Funding the development of compliance software demonstrates a commitment to empowering the Algorand community, enabling participants to navigate compliance requirements more effectively and fostering a supportive environment for developers and entrepreneurs.

Knowledge Sharing and Learning: The development process of compliance software involves extensive research and collaboration with legal and regulatory experts. The insights gained during this process can be shared with the broader community, contributing to knowledge sharing and education around compliance in the blockchain industry. This can help educate participants about compliance best practices and enable them to make informed decisions.

Positive Network Effects: A well-developed compliance software solution can have positive network effects on the Algorand ecosystem. As more participants adopt the software and engage in compliant activities, it creates a virtuous cycle where the network becomes more attractive to new users, leading to further growth and development.

Long-Term Sustainability: By investing in the open-source development of compliance software, the Algorand community lays the foundation for long-term sustainability and resilience. Compliance is an ongoing concern for blockchain platforms, and having dedicated software and ongoing support ensures that the Algorand ecosystem remains adaptable to evolving regulatory landscapes.
