## Abstract
Chaintrail is a blockchain intelligence & insights platform solely focussed on uncovering Algorand in full. We help the Algorand community understand what happens on-chain (per block) and which projects are gaining real adoption.

## Team
Founded by Leander [@nfnomad](https://twitter.com/nfnomad). 15+ years of experience in building (mobile) apps and e-commerce platforms. ~9 years of it as tech-exec for 2 separate startups leading product & tech. One scaled towards 300+ employees (100 in tech & product). At the moment solely focussed on building chaintrail.

## Experience with Algorand
Involved in Algorand blockchain since early 2021 (mostly as a user). Experimented with multiple Algorand SDK's and build several test projects to test out the waters on how Algorand works. 

Furthermore tracking lots of projects in the ecosystem. However, I missed a platform where it was all brought together and truly uncover the value that Algorand blockchain contains. Therefore decided to build Chaintrail in order to uncover such value.

## Roadmap
As the Algorand community on X knows is that I'm continously developing and uncovering new projects built on Algorand. In the past couple of months I've launched multiple things:

Dapp Leaderboard:
See which dapps were commiting the most on-chain transactions in the past week(s). 

NFT & RWA insights:
Uncovered sales from TravelX and Fifa+ Collect plus several other NFT marketplaces.

TVL:
Track TVL of multiple RWA's and other projects that no other platform has uncovered. Think of Agrotoken, Anote Music, Exodus $EXIT common stock, etc..

DeFi:
See which DeFi pools are yielding the best APR across multiple platforms. 

API: 
Made it possible for external platforms to easily use data aggregated by chaintrail. 

The coming months are set out to launch the following:
- Continue improving coverage of current and new dApps built.
- Improve interface of our NFT, TVL, Dapp & Stablecoin section.
- Expand our TVL section with more RWA projects.
- Combine dapp data from several sections into one insightful overview.

Whether or not this grant will pass. Chaintrail will still continue to develop further. As we have the backing of at least 40 paid community members at the moment (who pays $2.5 per month), which grows by the week. This grant will help make Chaintrail reach operational profitability in the short-term (next 3-6 months). However, our focus continues on selling pro memberships. Whereas the revenue results can be found here: https://chaintrail.io/revenue

## Benefits for the community
We're the only blockchain insights project that's focussed on one single blockchain: Algorand. This gives us the advantage that we can move a lot quicker and uncover data that hasn't been uncovered before. We did this already with NFT sales from TravelX & Fifa+ Collect, but also Agrotoken, Exodus their EXIT shares, Anote Music and many more in the near future. 

Plus our Dapps Activity (which is the fundament of Chaintrail) shows many insights to any Algorand follower of what's really driving on-chain traction/impact. Think of projects like: Hesab Pay, Fracctal Monsters, the weekly share of PlanetWatch and more.

This all benefits the community in terms of insights, knowing how Algorand is doing as an ecosystem. But also makes it easy to uncover new projects that you might not have seen before.

## Additional information
As stated before. This grant will contribute on keeping the lights on (the servers up and running) and support the project to continue growing further more easily. We published our current revenue stream (the amount of memberships sold): https://chaintrail.io/revenue. This will remain our main focus in terms of growing the project in a healthy manner. More on this can be read in our blog post: [Publishing our revenue](https://chaintrail-io.medium.com/publishing-our-revenue-13f4e659cf0b)

The grant I'm asking for is merely half of what is needed to keep the servers running and other costs. It doesn't count for future growth, as our engine continues to grow. So does the Algorand blockchain and the data we're tracking. Which means we slowly have to expand our infrastructure to keep a high-performing platform. Therefore we plan to submit a xGov proposal each quarter, while keeping the amount small and hopefully pass the bar for xGovs members.
