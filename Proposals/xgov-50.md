## Abstract
The proposal is designed to make the products that people use daily (such as clothes or food or electronics) so that they can contain an algorand nft and authenticate the originality of these products, and thus generate more users for the algo network and contribute to mass adoption.
Companies that accept this have a solution to the problem of piracy, smuggling and even against theft.
Each product will be traceable, it can be segmented by country to avoid contraband and also the nft will certify the authenticity of the product.
We already have serious approaches with wineries in Argentina, to incorporate nft to each bottle of wine. We have presented the proposals and we are starting to put together a dapp.
Sureblocks will be a symbol of safety for people. It could even be incorporated into medicines.

- Also, for each person who wants to claim your NFT, you must have $SOMETHING to pay the fee.
