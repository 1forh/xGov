## Abstract
The proposal is designed to make the products that people use daily (such as clothes or food or electronics) so that they can contain an algorand nft and authenticate the originality of these products, and thus generate more users for the algo network and contribute to mass adoption.
Companies that accept this have a solution to the problem of piracy, smuggling and even against theft.
Each product will be traceable, it can be segmented by country to avoid contraband and also the nft will certify the authenticity of the product.
We already have serious approaches with wineries in Argentina, to incorporate nft to each bottle of wine. We have presented the proposals and we are starting to put together a dapp.
Sureblocks will be a symbol of safety for people. It could even be incorporated into medicines.

He can write smart contracts with PyTeal, Beaker, TealScript and he knows how use the Algorand's SDK: Python, JavaScript and mostly Java.

## Present Proposal
This proposal was developed based on using the blockchain on a daily basis for all people but without people knowing that they are using web3 technology. Sureblocks will ensure the origin and originality of any daily use product with notarial level validation.
For example:
Have you ever bought a Nike, Lacoste, Adidas, etc. t-shirt? and you are not sure of its originality? ... Sureblocks.io is the definitive solution to all types of piracy and can be included in consumables, clothing, medicines, etc.
How does Sureblocks.io work?
The concept is to attach an NFT to the products that is issued by the manufacturer and that people can validate on our website.
Depending on whether the product is a can, a bottle, a t-shirt or a medicine, we have a different methodology for each one.
What everyday life situations would be solved?
- Prevent the sale of adulterated food
- Avoid product replicas
- It will prevent border smuggling of goods between neighboring countries.
- It will promote the loyalty of end consumers with the brands.
The NFT of each product will contain data such as production dates, expiration dates, product composition, manuals, warranty and all the technical specifications that the manufacturer desires. The NFT can also be collectible or used for promotions.

## Future Blueprint
To go a little more in detail about the proposal and its status here we detail it.
- Our website is sureblocks.io and the meaning of sureblocks is explained there. We also already have part of web3 included. sureblocks/login
- The log in screen contains the possibility that a web2 user can access all web3 tools without knowing it.
Commercially we have pre-agreements with companies that export wines from Argentina, and with wine cellars directly.
Also with artists to certify mixed art paintings, with which people will buy the painting through Nft's.

The main objective of sureblocks is to generate traffic on the blockchains through which it runs. Then the sending, the mining and other collaterals generated by the sureblocks certificates cause tokens of the native currencies of the blockchains to be consumed.
Due to the agreements we have, we believe that if the product is well associated with the nft and functions well, wineries will want to advance within all their product lines. For what art is, we believe that the commitment to mixed art is a very good idea since it is something that comes from the future and has just begun and the blockchain will be essential to have a limit of impressions, generate transferability and certify originality. For mixed art, we have a client with a wide variety of products.
To ensure the use of sureblocks and that the blockchains that support us have a good return, we decided to get into massive products such as wine, and then move on to also massive items such as art and music.
It is estimated in the first year of sureblocks about 100k of minted nft, during the second 250k, and third 1M only with the clients we have today. This could be exponential due to the chance of new clients joining.

## Benefits for the community
For Algorand, the benefits are immense, because all the people who are outside the crypto ecosystem today will begin to know the brand. Each product will contain a validator brought to the final consumer by Algorand and Sureblocks.
In the economic sense, we think that millions of nft will be transacted and all of these will generate fees that will be paid in the native currency of the blockchain.

## Additional information
We already have agreements with important wineries to progressively introduce this system on their products.
