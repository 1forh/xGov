## Abstract
Many of the Algorand projects heavily rely on Discord for interaction between creators and community. Common feature most of the projects require is assigning user discord roles and giveaways based on NFTs held in their associated wallets. There is no reliable and customizable discord bot that projects can simply use. We are here to fix this!

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
We will create and maintain an open source discord bot that allows users to associate wallet with their discord account. This will allow for easily assigning discord user roles based on the associated wallet inventory. Such as NFT holder, token holder, token tiers etc... We will provide a streamlined way to easily modify the bot for individual ASA project needs.

## Future Blueprint
There is a lot of potential to extend this bot for more fine-grained control over wallet inventories and event's based on that. Tipping, Giveaway feature, NFT battles, holder flexing, PFP/meme generating etc.

## Benefits for the community
New and existing proejcts can easily integrate the bot and instantly have more utility for their NFT collection or their token without needing to spend time and resources developing it in-house or trying to get an existing discord bot to integrate their token/collection and customize it for their needs.
