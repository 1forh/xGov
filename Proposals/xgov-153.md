## Abstract
This project aims to transform vehicle rental/operation for members of society who have not previously been able to afford such a luxury. This is not the tokenization of assets explicitly,
but a rather similar idea functionally. 

## Team
Project manager: B.A. of Business Administration with a degree in Business Management.  Technical Advisor: Ph. D in Computer Science.  
Developer: We will use contractors until the point in time whereby the dApp is needed to be created/maintained.  We are hoping to trade equity to a trusted group of unicorn developers when that time comes.

## Experience with Algorand
We have minted our ASA - and we have two to choose from.  One has 4B total supply and one has 8B - both are adequately positioned pricewise to offer a low entry point to investors in the token presale. 

## Present Proposal
Phase 1 - grant proposal, incorporation & legal/accoounting setup, token presale
Phase 2 - R&D the compatibility/integration aspect of the member's cellphone being the key to the vehicle.
Phase 3 - R&D the modification/re-programming necessary of the vehicle's on-board computer allowing monitoring and communicationg via the vehicle's on-board wifi - who is authorized operator, location, gas level, etc.
Phase 4 - Project rollout in one metropolitan area - currently thought to be in either Latin America or India.
Phase 5 - Expand as the financial health of the company allows.

The end product/subscription is aptly categorized as mobility-as-a-service.  The member will have the priviledge of using a motor vehicle for two separate 90 minute blocks per day - that they are allwoed to reserve.  
Their length of subscription will determine the hierarchy of reservation - meaning they will get the same 'place in line' every reservation sign-up period opening.  It's is thought that 
3 vehicles will be in the designated location - or at least 2, to allow for some inevitable friction within the operational environment.  The cost to these members will be around 60-80% of the local one-way rideshare cost.
We envision young people starting out - either in a committed relationship or just friendships - being able to cheuffeur one another to work/errands.  We share Algorand's goal of making better-life things possible.

## Future Blueprint
We have a 3-4 year plan to have vehicles available to the end-user/subscriber.  Then to expand as the financial health of the company allows from year 4-5 onward.  This is the reason it is currently considered 
desireable to only presale between 10-15% of the company's shares.  Our currently proposed pricing/entry point easily allows for $6 million to be generated from the 'presale' of this percentage.  This is accepted
as being enough to fund the project through phase 3.

## Benefits for the community
The benefits to the community are impossible to overstate.  Lots of new wallets, lots of MRB/Vs, lots of opt-ins to USDCgo, robust support to the Algorand defy sector, and of course daily transaction volume.

## Additional information

We will not sell our token in the United States.  We have a marketing strategy and website to target native Spanish speakers.  Coollife in Spanish is Vida Chida - www.vidachida.com is all ours!

We plan to use an NFT as the membership card to our service - which also serves as the keys to the vehicle by utilizing the internet connection to the vehicle or cellphone NFC technology
interacting with either our dApp or the Pera/Defly wallet.  This NFT will require an amount of our ASA to be burned to create - which will create a steady supply of market token buyers.  
If it's deemed a subscription to the dApp is better functionally, then say maybe half of the fee will automatically be used to burn tokens off the open market.  This is not some meme or moonshot coin.
Our ASA is tantamount to the new 'shares' of stock in a company.  Our plan is viable and our vision is supernatural.  This is a perfect trial use-case for this wonderful technology - thanks SM!
