## Abstract
We at Notiboy has a vision to make web3 communication more efficient. That means the algorand addresses should be able to communicate with each other by maintaining their privacy. So we are developing a chat application which will help the addresses to chat between each other in an anonymous way. There will also be a facility for group chat which will help formation and development of web3 communites. The users will also be able to send/transfer assets between addresses during their chat.

## Team
AP - CEO. I have 7 years of experience in sales and marketing of mobile handsets for multiple MNCs in India. I have been an active member in the Algorand community since August 2021 and is involved with the Angry Penguins NFT project.

Deepak -CTO. Deepak has a Masters in computer science and has worked in product design & development for leading payment companies in the world. He is well versed in the Algorand smart contracts and SDKs and has been leading the design and development of Notiboy project.

## Experience with Algorand
We have been building the Notiboy project and won 2nd prize during the 1st Green House Hackathon. We are one of the 6 teams that graduated from 1st cohort of the Algorand APAC accelerator.

## Present Proposal
In present proposal we would like to implement group chat which will allow projects to create communities without the complxities of discord. 
Also this will help them to maintain privacy. 
We will implement end to end encryption for better safety. 
NFDomains will be integrated for better user experience while chatting.

## Future Blueprint

### Milestone 2: Build a Group chat feature
Time Taken: 2 months

Amount: 50000

Description:
    - Group Chat feature which will allow cration of web3 communities without revealing any personal information of users involved.
    - End to end encryption for better safety.
    - Integrate NFDomains for better chat experience.

### Milestone 3: Transfer of assets on chat
Time taken: 1 months

Amount: 50000

Description:
    - Swapping assets between addresses while chatting
    - Sending assets between addresses while chatting
    - Release apis as a service so that projects can integrate chat app into their web3 application.


## Benefits for the community
1) Community members can interact with each other by using an algorand address as their identity. Currently, members have to expose their web2 identities, like email-id or phone numbers via a web2 platform to interact with other members or web3 projects.

2) Web3 projects on algorand can integrate our APIs to their application thus providing an in-app chat experience for 
their end-users.
