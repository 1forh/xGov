## Abstract

AlgoDirectory will be a decentralized, on-chain directory to the Algorand ecosystem.  The Directory will help users discover all that Algorand has to offer while enabling apps, projects, tools, and people to easily create and manage their own listings.

## Team

The AlgoDirectory team will consist of two members, Brian Whippo and Christian [TODO: LastName].

Christian [TODO: LastName] is [TODO: Insert bio here].

Brian Whippo is a self-taught, full-stack software developer passionate about bringing the promises of blockchain to the people.

## Experience with Algorand

Brian has been an active developer in the Algorand community since 2021 in various capacities:

- Built the open source <a href="https://thebonfire.app">Bonfire</a> app for for burning Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) in a permissionless, verifiable, and standardized way per the ARC-54 standard.  This project was funded by [xGov-86](xgov-87.md).
- Awarded 2nd Place in the Interoperability category of the Build-A-Bull hackathon for creating the <a href="https://pitch.com/v/Wormhole-Connect-Algorand-c5jjuf">Wormhole Connect + Algorand</a> SDK module.
- Built the open source <a href="https://solid-algo-wallets-example.netlify.app">Solid Algo Wallets</a> Javascript library for integrating several wallets into a web site.  This project was funded by [xGov-49](xgov-49.md).
- Created the open source <a href="https://xgov-viewer.netlify.app">xGov Viewer</a> app for reviewing xGov proposals and analyzing proposal voting data.  
- Awarded 3rd place prize in the 2022 Encode x Algorand Hackathon for a prototype of the <a href="https://alright.app">Alright</a> agreements protocol.
- Runs a residential participation node in Algorand consensus.

## Present Proposal

AlgoDirectory will be launched before the end of Q3 2024 and consist of a web user interface to view the Directory and a smart contract that manages the directory listings on chain.  Listing owners will be able to create and manage listings through a wallet connection.  Visitors will be able to browse directory listings through a web app that requires only a node connection 

## Benefits for the Community

AlgoDirectory will be the best first stop for new users upon joining the Algorand ecosystem, a valuable reference guide for existing Algorand enthusiasts, and the premier place for projects to be listed and discovered.

## Additional Information

AlgoDirectory will be the spiritual successor to directorydotalgo.xyz, a "Web2" directory site created and maintained by @tomonalgo until it became clear that a hand-curated model was unsustainable.  A central objective of AlgoDirectory is to actualize a protocol that decentralizes the creation and maintenance of directory listings to listing owners.  With data stored on chain and automated mechanisms to manage it, AlgoDirectory will live forever and enable custom interfaces to be made by the community.
