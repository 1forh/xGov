## Abstract
The Toy Collectibles market was estimated at 13bilion in 2022 and is estimated to grow to 25bilion by 2025. It is rapidly growing market that is also a great match to combine with NFT technology.

If succesfully funded we are partnering with an established player in the colletible toy industry that holds singinficant brand IPs for action toys that are also a perfect fit for our mobile game.

We will do a limited physical run of a known collectible toy and integrate it in our game as NFT. Each figurine will have its NFT counterpart. This will open Algorand to a whole new audience and pave the road for near future when industry behemots like Disney or Marvel will be looking for the blockchain to offer ther products as NFT + physicial collectibles.

## Team

Our partner is a well established and long-time present entity in posession of multiple IPs in the collectible toys market. They have significant experience with sourcing manufacturing and distributing physical collectibles worldwide.

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

Our partner is new to Algorand and they are looking to do a pilot with a trusted and established project in the space that can ensure that their part(nft + game integration) will be done without issues. Cosmic Champs fits that description perfectly!

## Present Proposal
We will launch a physical toy + NFT campaign with an established IP in the collectible world. Together with our partner we will produce a limited physical run of known action figurine, that will each be tied to an algorand NFT that will also be integrated with our mobile game. The figurine+nft pairs will be sold and distributed via online stores of our partner, in person on collectable/comics conventions, and via algorand NFT markets.

Basically we will do what nextg3nz failed to do, but efficiently, organically with actual positive impact on Algorand and user onboarding, and for a lot less funds and with high certainty! Our and our partners combined experience has all parts of the process covered. Further more the collectible physical toys + game nfts are a lot more natural and "sane" combination of the Real world Asset and virtual good and are something we are cofident will become a very popular trend in near future.


## Future Blueprint
In the future we are looking to bringing more IPs from the collectible world and their wast audiences to algorand.

## Benefits for the community
Doing this successfully will further position Algorand as the best chain for RWA. This will open Algorand to a whole new audience and pave the road for near future when industry behemots like Disney or Marvel will be looking for the blockchain to offer their products in NFT+phyisical  combination.
We will also show that phisical item + NFT can actualyl be exciting novelty and show that it can be done on algorand efficienty, professionally and in timely manner.
