## Abstract
<a href="https://galapago.app">Project Galapago</a> is setting its sights on becoming the first-ever peer-to-pool NFT lending platform on Algorand. 

Our goal? To completely change how NFTs are used in finance. 

For this ambitious task, we're asking for an ALGO grant for the first milestone of our project.
We're all about fairness. That's why we're only going to propose one milestone each quarter. 
This way, more projects can compete for grants in each xGov Grant batch.

What we're planning is groundbreaking. We want to create a fully decentralized platform where people can use their NFTs (or NFT & crypto) to get instant liquidity. This will unlock new possibilities for liquidity in the Algorand ecosystem. 
With our platform, the value of tokenized assets will be taken to the next level. 

Our vision is to open doors that have stayed closed until now.

### What is Project Galapago?
Project Galapago is a groundbreaking decentralized lending platform that enables users to borrow and lend against both Non-Fungible and Fungible tokens. 
By unlocking the latent capital in these tokens, Project Galapago aims to maximize capital efficiency and provide users with the opportunity to yield additional returns on their holdings.

We see a future filled with diverse tokenized assets with wide-ranging utility, applications, and connections to real-world assets. 
We predict a dramatic shift in the way valuable assets are transacted and accounted for in the next two decades. 

Project Galapago endeavors to be the bedrock of this transformation by providing a highly customizable, permissionless infrastructure to meet the emerging needs of efficient on-chain capital use. 
Our ultimate goal is to enpowering NFT users to unlock the true value of their assets.

### Addressing the Unmet Needs in NFT segment:
The crypto landscape is laden with assets of significant value in the form of Non-Fungible and Fungible Tokens. 
However, these assets often remain idle, leading to inefficiencies in capital utilization. 
Particularly, NFT owners find themselves in a dilemma where they have to sell their prized possessions to gain the liquidity necessary for further investments in NFTs or other avenues.

Current lending solutions fall short in terms of support for diverse types of collateral and don't allow users the flexibility to tailor their borrowing and lending strategies to their specific risk preferences. 
Additionally, they necessitate users to manage borrow positions against individual NFTs instead of a broader collection of both Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens.

Project Galapago is poised to address these challenges by enabling users to utilize multiple asset types as collateral, thus enhancing capital efficiency. This platform's revolutionary features will transform the way users borrow, lend, and manage their portfolio of Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens.
Under Project Galapago, our interpretation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) covers a broad spectrum of on-chain tokenized assets. These include, but are not limited to:

Tokenized Real-World Assets
Property tokens, examples being those from Lofty and Vesta Equity
Digital and physical art pieces, collectibles, and virtual game assets
NFDs and Opulous MFTs, among others

In our view, all these diverse entities fall under the umbrella of NFTs and are ripe for the unique financial applications we aim to develop.

## Roadmap
Project Galapago is a protocol designed to empower users to leverage their NFTs for loans. 
The distinctive feature of this protocol is its ability to collateralize NFTs either in a Peer-to-Peer or a Peer-to-Pool marketplace. 

The developmental journey of Project Galapago is divided into strategic milestones, each prioritized according to its immediate utility and need.
Every voting period focuses on the first yet-to-be-developed milestone, thereby fostering a dynamic, iterative development process steered by xGovernors' votes. 

The ALGO amount outlined for each milestone corresponds to the period of the proposal submission for that specific milestone. 
Consequently, the requisite ALGO amount for ensuing milestones might undergo adjustments based on future periods.

### Milstone 1
Title: **MainNet Debut with Instant Lending Peer-to-Pool Functionality**

Date: 20th Dec 2023

Estimated Duration: 10 weeks

Amount: 1250000 (development & audit costs)

Overview: This milestone marks the initial launch of Project Galapago on MainNet. This phase includes the introduction of an innovative instant lending peer-to-pool feature, alongside a security audit.
Features:
- instant NFT-backed loans with whitelisted NFT collections (initially 10)
- multi-collaterals
- using cryto(ALGO/USDC) together with NFTs as collateral
- deposit into ALGO/USDC liquidity pool and earn passive income
- withdraw from deposit from the pool instantly
- perpetual loan terms with no time duration. Loans are maintained by health factor that decided when the loan liquidation is triggered
- liquidation auction run by smart contract with participant incentives and opportunity to own blue chip NFTs with a discounted price.

### Milestone 2

Title: **NFT lending: Peer-to-peer market**

Date: 22/05/2024
Eatimated Duration: 13 weeks

Amount: 983000 ALGO (development & audit costs)

Description:
Milestone 2 will deliver a Peer to Peer lending market on top of the delivered peer to pool application from Milestone 1 with the following features:
- peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol that supports arbitrary collateral, including NFTs.
- loans have fixed rates and never expire, allowing borrowing positions to remain open indefinitely until liquidated.
- borrowers have the flexibility to repay their loans at any time, while lenders can exit their positions by triggering a Dutch auction to find a new lender at a new rate. If the auction fails, the borrower is liquidated, and the lender takes possession of the collateral.
- does not have any oracle dependencies and offers market-determined interest rates.
- matches users who want to borrow against their non-fungible collateral with lenders offering the most competitive rates.

## Benefits for the community
In the world of decentralized finance, Project Galapago stands out. We've gone beyond ideas and plans, and have built a fully-working product that's been tested on the Algorand Testnet. This makes us different from many other projects which are still in the idea stage. 
It also means there's less risk, because we've already built and tested our solution.
As soon as we secure the grant, we're ready to go live on the Algorand Mainnet in a couple weeks time. 

This is great news for the Algorand community. It means token holders can start using their NFTs and ALGO/USDC tokens to get loans almost immediately. 
It also means the whole Algorand ecosystem can start benefiting from our project right away.

Project Galapago isn't just for individual users. It will help the whole Algorand ecosystem. 
By allowing people to earn interest on their deposits and to buy collateralized NFTs at a discount, we're creating more activity and growth in the ecosystem. 
This will help other projects on Algorand to thrive.

We also offer a big boost to NFT-based projects like Opulous, NFD, and Lofty. By letting people get more use out of their tokens, we could help these projects attract more users. 
And marketplaces like RandGallery, ALGOxNFT, and EXA Market will benefit from increased activity and higher revenue from liquidation auction fees.

Project Galapago will also help NFT collections on Algorand. By allowing people to use these NFTs to get loans, we're making these digital assets more useful and valuable. 
This will encourage more people to get involved in NFT collections on Algorand.

Looking to the future, we believe more and more economic activity will move to blockchain. When that happens, we'll be ready. 
Our platform can work with any type of tokenized assets on Algorand. So as more economic value moves to blockchain, we'll be there to help capture and manage that value.

In short, Project Galapago is more than a project. It's a concrete contribution to the growth and strength of the Algorand ecosystem, now and in the future.
