## Abstract
In last period we added MNGO & AL GOANNA characters to Cosmic Champs PVP battle arena and they were both a huge hit. There is many more Algorand projects that are a great fit for our game. Unfortunatelly it's cost prohibitive for us to do such fun collabs as making a fully animated, game ready 3d NFT takes lots of resources. If funded, we will create and distribute these NFTs for free to help promote Algorand projects to our players and our game to the Algorand community. win-win

## Experience with Algorand
For the last 2 years, we have been building a p2e game on Algorand called Cosmic Champs. We are innovators in the 3d NFT space with our fully animated 3d NFTs that are used in our game and also have utility outside of the game itself (3d viewer, AR viewer).
We have a strong understanding of the NFT space, the technical specifications, and the supporting infrastructure available. This positions us well to deliver a strong product for other Algorand projects to use and benefit from.

## Present Proposal
After our proposal was approved in last period we have seen great success with the two proejcts that were selected (Al Goanna and MNGO). We would like to repeat this cross community collabs and bring some healty engagement between some of the OG Algorand communities. We will again select two proejcts that are a good fit and will for each one create a signature NFT character (multimint) that will be fully functional in our game.
We will provide these NFTs for free to their projects/communities and they can use them how they see fit. For an example to reward their communtiy or to run a competition. To get better idea here is two of our recent collab NFTs that are playable in our game: <a href="https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1280977773" target="_blank">MNGO</a> ,<a href="https://nft.cosmicchamps.com/nft/1108380528" target="_blank">PEPE</a> 

## Future Blueprint
In future we would like to create more of these NFTs to help cross promote Algorand Projects to our players and our game to Algorand ecosystem.

## Benefits for the community
These NFTs will have multiple benefits. They will promote other Algorand projects to players of our game and tehy will promote our game to wider NFT community. We will provide these NFTs (at no cost) for other projects to use within their community in any way they like. This will also help push narrative that NFTs can be so much more than just 2d pictures.
