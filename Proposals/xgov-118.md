## Abstract
  press.algo is creating the first ever WebMarket on Algorand. A WebMarket is an internet content marketplace where text, audio, and video are bought and sold. The monetization system on press.algo is simple. Using a pay-per-view system, press.algo ensures that the creator is paid for every view of their work, in perpetuity. The advantage of using Algorand for this type of system is the micropayments. Other content monetization services similar to press.algo like Patreon or Substack rely on credit cards and the traditional financial system, making it infeasible to run a micropayment marketplace for content.

## Team
Dugan Messman - Founder, CEO of press.algo

Scott Bolasevich - Lead Full-stack Developer

If this proposal is passed, press.algo will be able to expand the team.

## Experience with Algorand
  Dugan has been a member of the Algorand community since August 2022. He developed the idea for press.algo in September 2022. Since then, he has worked to make his idea a reality. His accolades include 3rd place at the AlgoHouse NYC pitch competition, 1st place at the AXL Ventures virtual pitch competition, and 2nd place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon. He's also had the chance to shake Silvio's hand at Decipher 2022. 


## Present Proposal
  press.algo is looking to use the 300,000 ALGO to develop a new platform. After receiving second place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon, press.algo has lacked the runway to develop a real business. The beta platform that currently exists is the result of a week of work. With funding, press.algo would be able to create a new platform that is user-friendly, efficient, and full of potential.

Technology Development (40% - 120,000 ALGO):

 - Creating efficient Algorand smart contracts
 - Developing a clean and robust front-end
 - Implementing cost-effective and long-term storage for content

Marketing and User Acquisition (20% - 60,000 ALGO):

 - Developing a strong, well-respected brand
 - Engaging in advertising, social media marketing, and partnerships
 - Attracting content creators through contests and referrals

Research and Development (15% - 45,000 ALGO):

 - Developing new ways for creators and viewers to earn
 - Understanding the current landscape of content monetization
 - Ensuring a user-friendly platform

Legal and Compliance (14% - 42,000 ALGO):

 - Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations
 - Protecting press.algo IP

Operations and Administration (10% - 42,000 ALGO):

 - Covering operational costs of the platform

Contingency Fund (1% - 3,000 ALGO):

 - Allocate funds for unexpected costs or opportunities

## Future Blueprint
  The goal of press.algo is to onboard the next 10,000 users to Algorand. In order to do so, there needs to be an uncomplicated place on the internet for people to spend and earn their ALGO, so people can see the technology in action. press.algo will provide this, by improving upon the beta platform and ensuring a seamless user experience. Creators will earn more per view and have a wider audience. Viewers will be incentivized with every click. press.algo is not developing a social media platform, this is something distinctly different. Money will be flowing to exchange ideas, in the first ever WebMarket. 
  
  To accomplish this goal, press.algo will be utilizing the funds allotted in different ways.
  
Technology Development (40% - 120,000 ALGO):
 - 120,000 ALGO for 1000 hours of work at 120 ALGO per hour
 - Paid in 20 hour increments

Marketing and User Acquisition (20% - 60,000 ALGO):
 - 30,000 ALGO for onboarding creators
 - 20,000 ALGO for onboarding viewers
 - 10,000 ALGO for partnerships

Research and Development (15% - 45,000 ALGO):
 - 30,000 ALGO for 250 hours of work at 120 ALGO per hour for development
 - 15,000 ALGO for 125 hours of work at 120 ALGO per hour for research

Legal and Compliance (14% - 42,000 ALGO):
 - 21,000 ALGO for patents
 - 21,000 ALGO for ensuring regulatory compliance

Operations and Administration (10% - 42,000 ALGO):
 - 42,000 ALGO for covering server and operational costs

Contingency Fund (1% - 3,000 ALGO):
 - 3,000 ALGO for unexpected costs or opportunities



## Benefits for the community
  press.algo will bring new users to the Algorand ecosystem. This application of blockchain technology, micropayment monetization, is vastly underdeveloped. press.algo is looking to be the first company to break through and become a friendly platform for crypto non-natives. This is possible because the "crypto" aspect of press.algo is less pronounced. The only use of Algorand on press.algo is the transactions. There are some new rules for this new system of monetization, but otherwise press.algo is familiar to everyone. You upload content, interact with it, and now, you earn money by using it.
