## Abstract
  There currently is no widely used application that uses blockchain technology. The average person still does not use blockchain to make transactions. They are stuck in the financial past. In the future, everyone will use Algorand like digital cash -- paying one another with peer-to-peer payments. press.algo is one of the first steps to achieving that future: a micropayment monetization system for internet content is vital infrastructure for onboarding every human on the planet to Algorand. With this grant, press.algo will develop a platform to onboard the next million crypto non-natives to Algorand, all the while developing never seen before use of the technology. 


## Team
Dugan Messman (dugan.algo) - Founder, CEO of press.algo

Scott Bolasevich (FlippingAlgos) - Lead Full-stack Developer


## Experience with Algorand
  Dugan has been a member of the Algorand community since August 2022. He developed the idea for press.algo in September 2022. Since then, he has worked to make his idea a reality. His accolades include 3rd place at the AlgoHouse NYC pitch competition, 1st place at the AXL Ventures virtual pitch competition, and 2nd place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon.

  Scott is a full-stack developer with 20+ years of experience. He has worked on over 30 projects in the Algorand ecosystem, including Nexus, Tucan Tribe, Jimcoin, THC, Buttcoin, Spawnlings, Al Goanna, Shufl, Taco Coin, Peperium, Outsyde, PRDAO, and many more. He developed the beta platform for press.algo in less than a week, which went on to win 2nd place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon. 

## Present Proposal
  press.algo is looking to use the 500,000 ALGO to develop a new platform. After receiving second place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon, press.algo has lacked the runway to develop a strong website. The beta platform that currently exists is the result of a few days of work. With funding, press.algo would be able to create a new platform that is user-friendly, efficient, and full of potential.
  To accomplish this, Dugan and Scott are preparing wire frames, workflows, and concepts to produce plans for the press.algo platform. They will do preparation work until funds are available for Scott to begin his development work. Scott will be working for 750 ALGO/hour for a total of 500 hours. This should be ample time to implement the plans that Dugan and Scott are preparing.
  This new platform will be a complete redesign of the existing beta platform. The core concept is the same -- allow creators to monetize their work to earn in perpetuity. The idea is simple, but expansive. There are so many ways to monetize clicks on the platform. Viewers will now have the chance to earn simply for using the platform. press.algo's idea enables a complete re-structuring of what we know about the internet.
    press.algo is targeting a non-crypto audience for this platform. This is why Algorand is the only blockchain for the job. No down-time, sub three second block times, and instant finality. The user experience on press.algo must be top class. To get the non-natives to stay, press.algo must act, look, and talk like a Web2 website. pressdot 
  press.algo is designed to be a sustainable business. This grant is meant to be a one time deal. press.algo will utilize the funds to develop a website that is self-sustaining, and will not rely on handouts to stay afloat. Every user on press.algo is a paying, incentivized customer. Using the press.algo monetization system benefits everyone. 
  

## Future Blueprint
  The goal of press.algo is to onboard the next 10,000 users to Algorand. In order to do so, there needs to be an uncomplicated place on the internet for people to spend and earn their ALGO, so people can see the technology in action. press.algo will provide this, by improving upon the beta platform and ensuring a seamless user experience. Creators will earn more per view and have a wider audience. Viewers will be incentivized with every click. press.algo is not developing a social media platform, this is something distinctly different. Money will be flowing to exchange ideas, in the first ever WebMarket. 
  
  To accomplish this goal, press.algo will be utilizing the funds allotted in different ways.
  
Technology Development (75% - 375,000 ALGO):
 - 375,000 ALGO for 500 hours of work at 750 ALGO per hour
 - Paid in 8 hour increments
 - All 375,000 ALGO will go to Scott over the course of two months
 - This is for a rate of ~$150/hr

Marketing and User Acquisition (15% - 75,000 ALGO):
 - 50,000 ALGO for onboarding creators and viewers
 - 25,000 ALGO for partnerships

Legal and Compliance (10% - 50,000 ALGO):
 - 50,000 ALGO to ensure legal compliance and secure press.algo IP


## Benefits for the community
  press.algo will bring new users to the Algorand ecosystem. This application of blockchain technology, micropayment monetization, is vastly underdeveloped. press.algo is looking to be the first company to break through and become a friendly platform for crypto non-natives. This is possible because the "crypto" aspect of press.algo is less pronounced. The only use of Algorand on press.algo is the transactions. There are some new rules for this new system of monetization, but otherwise press.algo is familiar to everyone. You upload content, interact with it, and now, you earn money by engaging with it.
