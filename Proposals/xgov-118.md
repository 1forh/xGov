## Abstract
  press.algo is creating the first ever WebMarket on Algorand. A WebMarket is an internet content marketplace where text, audio, and video are bought and sold. The monetization system on press.algo is simple. Using a pay-per-view system, press.algo ensures that the creator is paid for every view of their work, in perpetuity. The advantage of using Algorand for this type of system is the micropayments. Other content monetization services similar to press.algo like Patreon or Substack rely on credit cards and the traditional financial system, making it infeasible to run a micropayment marketplace for content.
