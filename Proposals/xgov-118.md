## Abstract
  press.algo is creating the first ever WebMarket on Algorand. A WebMarket is an internet content marketplace where text, audio, and video are bought and sold. The monetization system on press.algo is simple. Using a pay-per-view system, press.algo ensures that the creator is paid for every view of their work, in perpetuity. The advantage of using Algorand for this type of system is the micropayments. Other content monetization services similar to press.algo like Patreon or Substack rely on credit cards and the traditional financial system, making it infeasible to run a micropayment marketplace for content.

## Team
Dugan Messman - Founder, CEO of press.algo

Scott Bolasevich - Lead Full-stack Developer

If this proposal is passed, press.algo will be able to expand the team.

## Experience with Algorand
  Dugan has been a member of the Algorand community since August 2022. He developed the idea for press.algo in September 2022. Since then, he has worked to make his idea a reality. His accolades include 3rd place at the AlgoHouse NYC pitch competition, 1st place at the AXL Ventures virtual pitch competition, and 2nd place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon. He's also had the chance to shake Silvio's hand at Decipher 2022. 


## Present Proposal
  press.algo is looking to use the 300,000 ALGO to develop a new platform. After receiving second place at the Build-A-Bull hackathon, press.algo has lacked the runway to develop a real business. The beta platform that currently exists is the result of a week of work. With funding, press.algo would be able to create a new platform that is user-friendly, efficient, and full of potential.
