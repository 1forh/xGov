## Abstract
This proposal aims to build a highly intuitive, no-code voting system that enables any user, brand, DAO, or community to deploy voting contracts for streamlined proposal creation, decentralized decision-making and instant polling.

With a focus on accessibility and a streamlined user-experience, the platform aims to onboard teams and communities from within and outside the Algorand ecosystem. We aim to create the most user-friendly voting system within crypto, while supporting a range of voting models and use cases.

## Experience with Algorand
Jesco has been actively developing Algorand based projects for >3 years. In this time he has created ~20 PyTeal smart contracts and multiple Front / Back ends to support this. The smart contracts cover a wide range of application types, including staking, vesting, trading, and more.

Mark has worked as a Product Manger / Product Designer on many projects including mobile apps, enterprise web apps, and web3 projects.

Together, Mark and Jesco have been building the www.everyone.space platform for the past year. When launched, Everyone will provide key tokenization and NFT infrastructure for the Algorand ecosystem.

## Present Proposal
The proposed voting system will enable anyone to create a custom governance system aligned to their project's specific needs, whether that is critical decision making, instant polling, community engagement, or feedback acquisition. With a focus on accessibility, we aim to streamline onboarding and increase participation from both new and existing users and teams. 

This no-code voting system will be integrated with the upcoming Everyone platform, joining a suite of user-friendly, no-code tokenization and contract deployment utilities for the Algorand network. By unifying voting tools together with other essential project and team administration features, users and brands will benefit from a streamlined voting experience that works synergistically with other key web3 utilities.

The integrated end-to-end solution that combines tokenized assets with coordinated voting models and permissions, will facilitate a more seamless and transparent decision making process, promoting trust, engagement, and inclusivity across the whole Algorand ecosystem.

Key Features:
* Highly intuitive, no-code voting contract deployment
* Multiple voting models to support diverse governance use cases
  * Token-weighted voting
  * Quadratic voting
  * Simple Majority Voting
  * Supermajority Voting
  * Polls
* Dedicated webpage for project-specific voting experiences
  * Comprehensive project information
  * Real-time voting and results
  * Voting activity and history
* Public and private voting
  * Support for sensitive decision-making and IP protection
* Access controls and feature permissions
  * Specify token requirements for proposal creation and voting
  * Integration with staking mechanisms
* Enhanced transparency and trust
  * Immutable records with verifiable voting history

## Future Blueprint
We plan to support and improve the voting features over the long term, and far beyond the scope of this proposal.

## Benefits for the community
Key benefits:
* A core goal of the project is to expand the Algorand user base by attracting new users, brands, and teams from outside the Algorand ecosystem.
* Provide an improved voting experience for existing Algorand ecosystem projects.
* Aims to promote a fairer, more engaged, and inclusive ecosystem.
