## Abstract
Vote Coin DAO incentivizes low AMM LP fee pools so that the algorand ecosystem has better incentivization on better DEX aggregators and for end users the swap quotes between bitcoin, algorand and usdc are better.

We request grant to increase the AMM liquidity. With 32k Algos received from this grant we will split it to 4 baskets equaly - algo, usdc, btc and gold. Vote coin DAO will add equal stake in $vote tokens and will increase the liqudity in the pools.

We will increase these pools:
- Vote/Algo - 8k algo plus vote token worth of 8k algo
- Vote/USDC - USDC worth 8k algo plus vote token worth of 8k algo
- Vote/BTC - BTC worth 8k algo plus vote token worth of 8k algo
- Vote/Gold - ASA.Gold token worth 8k algo plus vote token worth of 8k algo
