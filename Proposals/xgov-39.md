## Abstract
Build a Humble.sh connector for the open source Hummingbot market making bot and maintain the connector for the first 6 months

## Team

## Experience with Algorand
CoinAlpha has recently built a Hummingbot connector for Tinyman, and Algorand based DEX.

## Roadmap
A detailed plan for the development and implementation of the proposal, including timelines.

### Step 1
Date: 4 weeks upon approval of the grant
Description: Delivery of the connector code to the Hummingbot Foundation

### Step 2

Description: CoinAlpha will provide the necessary votes to get the connector merged into the next production releasele(determined by the Humminngbot Foundation)

## Benefits for the community
The Hummingbot open source community generates over 100MM of daily traded volume accross all supported exchanges. The connector will allow Humble to tap into this community of traders and small market makers, helping it expand its user base and grow their trading volume. Addittionally, since many community participants specialize in arbitrage, this will also help them align prices. All of these, in turn, benefits the overall Algorand community, by helping drive adoption and transactions onchain.
