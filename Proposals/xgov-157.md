## Abstract
This proposal outlines the development of a centralised bridge facilitating the seamless transfer of Cardano (ADA) and Algorand (ALGO). The bridge aims to provide users on both networks with a secure and efficient means to transfer and utilise assets across ecosystems, with all bridged assets held in cold storage through our custody provider. Why centralised? Speed and simplicity of implementation, a decentralised version though desirable would take significantly longer and require more resources. Additional research into implementation of a decentralised iteration will be continued for future development.

### Bridge Development (260,000A)
- **Infrastructure Setup:** Establish a secure and robust infrastructure for the centralised bridge.
- **Custody Provider Integration:** Integrate with a reputable custody provider to securely store bridged assets in cold storage.
- **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for users to initiate and monitor cross-chain transactions.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct thorough security audits to ensure the safety and integrity of the centralised bridge.
- **Integration Testing:** Perform extensive testing to validate the bridge's functionality and security.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the centralised bridge, custody integration, and user interface components.

## Experience with Algorand
Algomint is a pivotal contributor to the Algorand ecosystem, specialising in a centralised bridge for seamless and secure asset transfer between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with Algorand. Their expertise lies in establishing a robust infrastructure, integrating reputable custody providers, and creating user-friendly interfaces for efficient cross-chain transactions. Beyond the bridge, Algomint demonstrates proficiency in enhancing liquidity through innovative basket utility. This strategic approach allows users to leverage Algorand's capabilities for instant transactions while accessing a diverse range of assets. Algomint is committed to growth and ecosystem support.


## Present Proposal
This proposal seeks funding of 260,000A  to develop a centralised bridge between Cardano and Algorand, providing users with a reliable means to transfer both ADA and ALGO across these ecosystems, with bridged assets securely held in cold storage through our custody provider.

## Benefits for the community
This opens up the ability to collaborate with Cardano projects and incentivise Cardano users to bridge and try Algorand technology, DeFi and general ecosystem.

- **Effortless Cross-Chain Transactions:** Algomint's centralised bridge guarantees smooth and secure asset transfers, enhancing interoperability between Cardano and Algorand and boosting cross-chain liquidity.

- **Centralised Security Confidence:** By leveraging a trusted custody provider, Algomint ensures the secure cold storage of bridged assets, fostering user confidence in the integrity and safety of cross-chain transactions.

- **User-Friendly Interface for Growth:** Algomint prioritises a user-friendly interface, simplifying cross-chain transactions and strategically attracting users, particularly from the Cardano community. This approach contributes to the expansion and diversification of both ecosystems.

- **Marketing:** Building a bridge between Cardano and Algorand will support cross chain marketing penetration and will open future marketing and growth opportunities for both Algomint and other ecosystem projects.
