## Experience with Algorand

Unnamed was built on Algorand Python SDK, and there is currently one project, which is Unnamed Wallet. We are new to Algorand and we are aware of Dapps (i.e. used them, exploring how Dapps work on Algorand)

## Roadmap

Unnamed Wallet has currently finished building the fundemental part of the wallet, which can handle the generation of new addresses and basic transactions. There is till more work to do to make Unnamed Wakket the wallet that many people will use:

### Milestone 1: GUI
Date: No dateline
Amount: -
Description: Implementing Tk GUI in Unnamed Wallet to give user better User Experience and convenience

### Milestone 2: Code modification
Date: No dateline
Amount: -
Description: Modify code to prepare integration of GUI. Unnamed Wallet will be able to use both the GUI and the Command Line Interface after the modification

### Milestone 3: Proof of Concept for Dapps/Single Account/Rekeying functionality on Unnamed Wallet
Date: No dateline
Amount: -
Description: Due to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unnamed_wallet/comments/12zem6k/about_rekeying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3">votes</a> being inconclusive, a separate wallet that is purely Proof of Concept has to be built for Algorand users to experience how it is like to use the functionality. Afterwards, conduct another vote to see sentiment

## How your donations will be utilized
At the time of writing, the amount requested is about $1000 USD
To be able to spend the donations, a threshold of $1000 USD has to be exceeded
This is due to financial sustainability of Unnamed
Unnamed will set aside some amount for "rainy days" and anything below or at $1000 USD, the donations shall not be spent no matter what unless absolutely needed
Once the $1000 USD has been exceeded, only then can the donations be spent
The donations shall be first used to pay for infrastructures that Unnamed Wallet will depend on like node APIs for example so that everyone will be able to use the API without any problems
The excess will be distributed to the volunteers according to what is left and how many volunteers has contributed to the projects (i.e. Unnamed Wallet, etc)

## Transparency
Unnamed and Unnamed Wallet uses a new address each time there is a new donation request or any receiving transactions, as well as outgoing transactions. All of the addresses will be posted in <a href="https://discord.gg/kePECdcXad">Unnamed's Discord server</a> in the <i>#endowments</i> channel so that you (the donor) will be able to see how your donations are being used

If you have any questions related to donations, you may ask them in the <i>#crowdsourcing</i> channel
